The cases are simulated as follows:
Each case will be labeled as follows: 
	For the compiled folder: NAME_turbulence-closure_lv-levelnumber
	For the after running folder: NAME_turbulence-closure_lv-levelnumber_results
Dont forget to put in the name of the folder in the cfg.txt file and change the names in the run.sh, cpp.keys file
Also make sure you are using the correct key for the turb scheme and the correct initial condition files for the levels


Cases done so far:
All turbulence closures:
	Reffray:
		75 levels
		


	Southern Ocean:
